# Docker-demo

A simple project to get started with Docker.

## Play with Docker

For interactive Docker sessions, you can use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create Empty Files

Create empty files for your Docker project:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
touch app.py
touch requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Copy File Contents to Host

Now, add the content to `Dockerfile`, `app.py`, and `requirements.txt` on your local machine.

### Step 3: Build Docker Image

Build the Docker image for your Python web app:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-web-app .
```

### Step 4: Create Container from Image

Run a Docker container from the created image:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-web-app
```

Your Flask web application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

### Step 5: Stop All Running Containers

Stop all running Docker containers:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Step 6: Remove All Containers

Remove all Docker containers:

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Step 7: Remove All Images

Remove all Docker images:

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

Feel free to adapt these steps based on your project's specific needs. Happy Dockerizing!

This format provides detailed instructions for each step within the README.md file.
